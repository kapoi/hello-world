I just watched a bunch of videos about computers and operating systems.
As a result of this I am trying to install Ubuntu on a separate PC to the one i'm currently using.
This is probably a mistake as my computer knowledge is limited to modding PC games, general knowledge, and google-fu.
I kept hearing open-source and remembered downloading TF2 mods from here so i decided to se what this all is.
